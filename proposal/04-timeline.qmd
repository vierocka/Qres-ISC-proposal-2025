# Project plan

## Start-up phase
Collaboration platform: We will host all code on GitHub under an open repository (qres-platform), including the API, Shiny interface, and R package. Issues and pull requests will be used to manage contributions from collaborators and the community.

License decisions: All code will be released under the MIT license; data schemas and metadata standards will be released under CC-BY 4.0 to maximize reuse.

Reporting framework: We will provide quarterly progress updates to the ISC, including blog posts summarizing milestones. The GitHub repository will include a project board to track deliverables.

## Technical delivery
Months 1–2: Finalize schema design, API blueprint, GitHub repo setup, and automated CI/CD pipeline for the R package.

Months 3–4: Implement database backend and API endpoints; first internal prototype of data upload form.

Months 5–6: Release alpha version of QresR package (GitHub); API documentation available online.

Months 7–8: Extend Shiny interface with validated data submission and visualization modules; first external test submissions.

Months 9–10: Integrate predictive tools (Python/Julia) and DGrowthR; provide R wrappers.

Months 11–12: Community testing with CRC1310/FiMAR/Helmholtz datasets; finalize CRAN release of QresR; publish white paper/guidelines.

## Other aspects

Licensing: Code under MIT; data standards and metadata under CC-BY 4.0.

Hosting: Public GitHub repository with issue tracking and contribution guidelines; Shiny app hosted on University of Cologne’s R Shiny server.

Dissemination:
1. Announcement blog post on R Consortium blog at project start.
2. Quarterly blog updates on progress.
3. Delivery blog post on release of QresR (CRAN).
4. Presentations at UseR! 2026, ISC meetings, and relevant microbiology conferences.
5. Social media announcements (via CRC1310, FiMAR, and partner institutes).

## Budget & funding plan

Funding is requested primarily for labor costs:
Two PhD students (12 months each)
1. PhD student 1 (Software Development & Data Engineering): Responsible for database, API, and storage pipelines.
2. PhD student 2 (R/Shiny/API Development): Responsible for R package, Shiny interface, and automated data submission.
3. The PI (Viera Kováčová, University of Cologne) will supervise the project but does not request salary support.
4. No funds are requested for travel, publication fees, or hardware. University of Cologne provides server infrastructure.

| Role                                                    | FTE | Duration  | Cost per year (€) | Total (€)   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| PhD Student 1 – Software Development & Data Engineering | 1.0 | 12 months | 76,500            | 76,500      |
| PhD Student 2 – R/Shiny/API Development                 | 1.0 | 12 months | 76,500            | 76,500      |
|Total Personnel                                          | 2.0 | 12 months | –                 | 153,000     |


Milestones tied to funding release:
Month 4: API + database schema complete → €30,600
Month 6: Alpha R package + API documentation → €30,600
Month 8: Shiny submission system + visualization → €30,600
Month 10: Integration with external tools + DGrowthR → €30,600
Month 12: CRAN release, guidelines, dissemination → €30,600

# Budget Justification
The requested funding is dedicated entirely to two full-time PhD student positions for 12 months. One PhD student will focus on software development and data engineering (database design, storage pipelines, REST API), while the second will focus on R/Shiny and API development (R package, submission interface, visualization). This division of labor is essential to ensure rapid and parallel progress across the backend and user-facing components of Qres. The PI (Viera Kováčová) will supervise the project but does not request salary support, ensuring that 100% of ISC funds are invested directly into infrastructure development for the R community.
