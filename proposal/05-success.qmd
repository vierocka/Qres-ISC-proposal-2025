# Success
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a
thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->

## Definition of done
The project will be considered complete and successful when:
1. The Qres database and REST API are fully operational, allowing storage and retrieval of dose–response datasets with curated metadata.
2. The QresR package is publicly released on CRAN and GitHub, enabling R users to programmatically query, preprocess, and analyze datasets.
3. The Shiny interface supports automated data submission (with validation) and interactive download/visualization of raw data and fitted models.
4. Integration with at least one external predictive tool (Python/Julia) and DGrowthR is demonstrated through vignettes and tutorials.
5. Community guidelines / white paper on best practices for dose–response experiments are published and disseminated.

## Measuring success
Success will be measured using concrete, trackable outputs:
1. Technical outputs:
* QresR package accepted on CRAN.
* API documentation publicly available.
* Shiny interface deployed with submission/download capability.

2. Community uptake:
* At least 5 external datasets submitted and validated through the automated submission system.
* Engagement of early adopters from CRC1310, FiMAR, Human Technopol, and Helmholtz.

3. Dissemination:
* Release of at least 2 vignettes/tutorials demonstrating workflows in R.
* Publication of guidelines for dose–response data management and modeling.

## Future work
Once Qres reaches full functionality, we will prepare a high-impact publication describing its architecture, features, and scientific use cases. The manuscript will highlight:
* The need for standardized, FAIR-compliant dose–response data.
* Qres infrastructure (database, API, R package, Shiny interface).
* Integration of predictive tools across R, Python, and Julia.
* Demonstration datasets from microbial resistance and cancer evolution.
* Benchmarks comparing automated analysis pipelines (e.g. DGrowthR, Kinbiont).

Target journals could include Nature Biotechnology, Nature Communications, Nucleic Acids Research (Database issue), or Bioinformatics.

This publication will provide a citable reference for Qres, ensuring that dataset contributors receive recognition and that the platform is embedded in the global research ecosystem.
