# Signatories
This section summarizes the individuals and groups who support, contribute to, or have been consulted on the Qres proposal. The project is already embedded in large research networks (CRC1310, CRC1678, FiMAR, Human Technopol, Helmholtz) and has broad community visibility.

## Project team
Viera Kováčová, PhD (viera.kovacova@uni-koeln.de) – Principal Investigator. Leads the development of Qres, supervises technical and scientific progress, and coordinates collaborations.

Prof. Michael Lässig (lassig@uni-koeln.de) – Director of CRC1310. Provides strategic oversight and advice on the broader scientific vision.

Prof. Andreas Beyer (andreas.beyer@uni-koeln.de) – Director of CRC1678. Advises on systems biology integration and data-driven approaches.

Stephan Kleinboltig (kleinboltig@uni-koeln.de) – CRC1310 project manager. Supports administrative coordination and R server infrastructure at the University of Cologne.

Two PhD Students (to be hired) – Dedicated to (1) software development and database/API implementation, and (2) R/Shiny/API development and user interface.

## Contributors
Prof. Ville Mustonen (FiMAR, Helsinki) – Provides predictive modeling expertise, helps shape the scientific scope, and engages international collaborators to contribute datasets.

Dr. Fernanda Pinheiro (Human Technopol, Milan) – Leads development of the Kinbiont Julia package for bacterial growth modeling; collaborates on integration into Qres.

Medina Feldl (Helmholtz, Munich) – Developer of the DGrowthR package; contributes to Qres integration for bulk dose–response analysis.
