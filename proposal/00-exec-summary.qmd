# Executive Summary

Dose–response data are fundamental to research in microbiology [@Lukacisinova2020], oncology [@Kuosmanen2021], pharmacology [@Bretz2025; @Wang2020], biophysics [@Petrungaro2025], and toxicology [@Lukacisin2019]. Yet raw datasets remain fragmented, inconsistently formatted, and often lack metadata, making them difficult to integrate into reproducible R workflows. Frequently, raw measurements are not shared at all, with only fitted curves or summary metrics (such as IC₅₀/OD₅₀) reported—sometimes based on methods inappropriate for the underlying data [@Bayer2023; @Wang2020].

In practice, raw dose–response data are stored in **small plain-text files reporting time and measured values**. Even for large-scale, parallelized experiments recorded on robotic systems over several weeks, these files rarely exceed **1 MB in size**, making them highly portable and easy to archive. When available, raw time-resolved growth data enable robust model benchmarking, transparent comparison of analytical methods, and reproducibility across studies. Beyond replication, curated raw datasets open the door to predictive modeling of evolutionary dynamics and treatment outcomes [@Kuosmanen2021; @Angaroni2025], offering a unique opportunity to accelerate both fundamental discovery and translational applications.

The [Qres platform](https://growthcurvedb.shinyapps.io/growthcurvedb/) is an open-access dose–response database and web service hosted at the [University of Cologne](https://crc1310.uni-koeln.de/). Qres is designed to transform how raw microbial and cancer cell growth curve data are collected, curated, and analyzed. By centralizing access and standardizing analysis, Qres will speed up progress in understanding resistance dynamics and cellular responses under perturbation. This proposal requests R Consortium support to expand Qres from its current use within [CRC1310: Predictability in Evolution](https://crc1310.uni-koeln.de/) to a fully R-integrated, open-source resource accessible to the global R community and beyond.

The project will deliver:\
- A **public API** and an **R package** (`QresR`) for standardized data access, database storage, and analysis.\
- An **enhanced R Shiny interface** to upload and download raw data with metadata, validate new datasets, and enable interactive visualization and analysis directly in the browser.\
- **Integration of predictive tools** developed in Python by [Prof. Ville Mustonen, FiMAR](https://www.fimar.fi/) and in Julia by [Dr. Fernanda Pinheiro, Human Technopole, Milan](https://humantechnopole.it/en/), enabling cross-language interoperability.\
- Incorporation of the [DGrowthR package](https://bio-datascience.github.io/DGrowthR/) [@Feldl2025] developed at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en) as an analysis option for bacterial growth data.

Key outputs include an R package released on CRAN, standardized data formats, reproducible workflows, and community guidelines establishing **best practices and gold standards** for dose–response experiments. All analytical tools developed within Qres will be **species agnostic**, ensuring applicability across microbes, cancer models, pharmacological assays, and toxicology screens. By bridging R with Python and Julia tools, Qres will provide a foundation for AI-driven analysis and long-term reproducible science. This project directly addresses the R Consortium’s mission by strengthening technical infrastructure, fostering interoperability, and serving a broad international user base across biology, biophysics, and medicine.

The requested budget of **€50,000** will be used entirely for direct project development: a part-time developer for database and API design, a student assistant for metadata curation and testing, limited infrastructure costs, and targeted consultancy to optimize code and workflows. The PI does not request salary support, ensuring that all funds directly advance infrastructure for the R community.
