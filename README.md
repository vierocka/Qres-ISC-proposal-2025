Proposal Overview

Dose–response data are fundamental to research in microbiology, oncology, pharmacology, biophysics, and toxicology; yet, raw datasets remain fragmented, inconsistently formatted, and often lack metadata, making them challenging to integrate into reproducible R workflows. QRes platform is a web-based platform hosted at the University of Cologne that collects, processes, and analyzes dose–response datasets. This proposal seeks R Consortium support to expand QRes into a fully R-integrated, open-source resource for the global R community.
The project will deliver a public API and R package for standardized data access, improved database storage and schema, and an extended R Shiny interface for data upload, processing, and visualization. QRes will integrate predictive tools developed in Python and Julia by Prof. Ville Mustonen (FiMAR, Helsinki) and Dr. Fernanda Pinheiro (Human Technopol, Milan), enabling cross-language interoperability. In addition, the DGrowthR package (developed by Medina Feldl at Helmholtz, Munich) will be incorporated as an analysis option for bulk dose–response data.
Key outputs include an R package released on CRAN, standardized data formats, reproducible workflows, and community guidelines establishing best practices and gold standards for dose–response measurements. By bridging R with Python and Julia tools, Qres will provide a foundation for AI-driven analysis and long-term reproducible science.
This project directly addresses the R Consortium’s mission by strengthening technical infrastructure, fostering interoperability, and serving a broad international user base across biology, biophysics, and medicine.
